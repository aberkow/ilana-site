      <p>
        Since August 2005, I've served the community of <a href="https://www.bethelwesthartford.org/">Beth El Temple in West Hartford Connecticut</a>. I graduated from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, with a bachelor’s degree in Talmud (2000), a master’s degree in Jewish education (2003), and rabbinic ordination (2005). I have also received a bachelor’s degree in religion from Barnard College (2000), writing a thesis entitled, “Can One be an Observant Jew and a Practicing Buddhist?” (<Link to="/contact">You'll have to chat with her to find the answer!</Link>)
